Held every year in summer, the UBC Engineering Physics Robot Competition has served as a kind of trial by flame for generations of second-year engineering physics students. Team of 3 or 4 students get together and over the course of 5 intense weeks design, build, and troubleshoot an autonomous robot capable of completing a pre-defined task.

This year, the theme is Mission Impossible Bots, and our task was to build self-driving cars to rescue six trapped secret agents by avoiding an alarmed door, driving up a narrow ramp, rescuing the agents from a tank filling with water and sending the agents back to safety on a zipline while obeying additional [rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g9UG_ID7YxdN3Vdt_oRrXJgGzr4VSbbwLGS0zG9mbSA/edit)

To tackle this challenge, we dubbed ourselves "Walkerville Elementary" and got started on the Magic School Bot right away. Though the magic school bot might have started life as a cardboard prototype, by the end of the 5 weeks of build time it proved to a robot we could all be proud of.

Finally, we'd like to thank the instructors (Andre, Jon, Bernhard) as well as the TAs (Connor S, Connor H, and Reily)
