Held every year in summer, the UBC Engineering Physics Robot Competition has served as a kind of trial by flame for generations of second-year engineering physics students. Team of 3 or 4 students get together and over the course of 5 intense weeks design, build, and troubleshoot an autonomous robot capable of completing a pre-defined task.

This year, in 2017, our theme is Mission Impossible. [talk about specifics] [something something namedrop ourselves]
