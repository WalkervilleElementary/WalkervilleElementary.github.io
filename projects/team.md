title: 'Walkerville Elementary'
---

Composed of 4 second-year Engineering Physics students at UBC, Walkerville Elementary is a team united by a common goal: creating the best robot for the competition! Along the way, they've also meandered through physics labs, dealt with the struggles of unintentionally ungrounded wires, and put their culinary skills to the test.
